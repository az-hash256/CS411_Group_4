As an avid basketball fan, I want to be able to create a list of my favorite players and keep track of their information. I should be able to have all the statistics about my favorite players in one place so that I don't have to look them up one by one. When I click on a player in my favorite players' list, I should be able to view that player's statistics (e.g. points, assists, rebounds, etc.). If this feature doesn't work, then a message should be shown to the user regarding an invalid entry.
