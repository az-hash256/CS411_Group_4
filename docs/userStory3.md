As a general user, I want to be able to log into the app and see my favorite team's previous and upcoming games. I should be able to log into my Google account and access this information. I want to look at Knicks games, so I should be able to filter out non-Knicks games and only be able to see previous and upcoming Knicks games. If this feature works successfully, I should be able to see the next week's worth of games of my favorite team right when I log into the app. In the case where I can't log in, a message will be shown to the user regarding invalid log-in credentials.
