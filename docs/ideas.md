- Using NBA Data API(https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/) as well as the Ticketmaster API (https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/), create a web application that allows users to track their favorite players, teams, and upcoming games. The data for these will be taken from the NBA Data API. In the scenario where users look at upcoming games, the Ticketmaster API can be implemented. Users will be able to see prices of such games and be able to find the price they are looking for. The database will store information on the user, including their login information, favorite team/players, and tickets they've purchased.

- Using the Pokemon TCG API(https://pokemontcg.io/) as well as the OpenWeatherMapAPI(https://openweathermap.org/), create a web application that serves as a card collection app for Pokemon cards. When users log into the app, Pokemon cards will be generated based on the current weather at their current location. For example, on a rainy day, water types will be present in the shop, and fire types will not. Users can "purchase" these cards with a set amount virtual money that is generated each day. Leveling up can increase the amount of money generated each day.
