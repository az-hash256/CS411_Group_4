As an NBA player, I want to track my own statistics and see how my team and I are currently doing. I should be able to login to the app, favorite myself and my team, and should be able to track my statistics, my team's statistics, as well as team standings. A successful implementation of this feature will allow me to see the stats of my team and myself when I login. An unsuccessful implementation would return info to the user regarding player/team not found.
