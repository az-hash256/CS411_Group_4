When we first started, the two tech stacks we were considering were MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and Angular, Django, and Firebase. In the end, we decided to choose the MERN stack as our application of choice. Although Angular and Django are popular frameworks and unique features, we felt that this stack was a bit too complex for our group's skill level. We wanted to choose something that was easy to pick up and had lots of information online, which would help our implementation. In our opinion, React is much more straightforward than Angular, and more of our team members knew the MERN stack vs the latter option. In general choosing to use the MERN stack helps us focus on the project at hand rather than on syntactical issues.
