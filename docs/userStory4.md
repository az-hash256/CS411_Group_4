As a journalist, I want to track recent statistics of certain players in order to write about them in the upcoming newsletter. I should be able to log in and search for a player, and I should be able to access information/graphs regarding recent game performances. A successful implementation of this feature will allow users to see these statistics when they click on a specific player. In a case where this feature doesn't work, that means that the player that the user is searching for is not a real player and this information should be displayed to the user.
