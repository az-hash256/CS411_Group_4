Ideas: 
Using NBA Data API(https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/) as well as the Ticketmaster API (https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/), create a web application that allows users to track their favorite players, teams, and upcoming games. The data for these will be taken from the NBA Data API. In the scenario where users look at upcoming games, the Ticketmaster API can be implemented. Users will be able to see prices of such games and be able to find the price they are looking for. The database will store information on the user, including their login information, favorite team/players, and tickets they've purchased.

App Interface/UX/UI:

3 pages: Games, Teams, Players
Navbar to navigate to these diff tabs (right handed)
Login/Signin button on navbar
Must be logged in to view favorite players/teams
games displayed based on date that user chooses (limited to current season?)
Favorite players must be current players, favorite teams should be current teams
